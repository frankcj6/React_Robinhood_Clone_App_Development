### Description
This web app is the clone of the Robinhood App. Robinhood is a trading App that supports commission-free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds. This project is using React+Finnhub+Ruby as the development stack. 

### Development Tools
We are using React+ Finnhub +Ruby as the development tool. 

For React, start the React App by using the following command:

```console
npx create-react-app robinhood-clone
```

We are using the 'VS Code ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets' for JS function development. The real time trading data are pulled from Finnhub API. Finnhub is an open-source Financial API platform. The API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. This is 1 of the most comprehensive financial API available on the market. At the same time, the front-end interface are edit by CSS and HTML.
